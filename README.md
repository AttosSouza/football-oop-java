# Introduction 

This is a mini project designed to showcase and apply my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

The project revolves around the representation of a football (soccer) team, simulating its key components and interactions.
It features 8 classes and an interface, each playing a distinct role in modeling the real-world entities and relationships within a football club.

# Overview of Classes and Interface:

- **Player:** Represents individual team players, with attributes like name, age, and position.

- **Employee:** An abstract class that defines common attributes and behaviors for all team personnel, serving as a foundation for specialized subclasses such as Jogador (Player) and Treinador (Coach).
